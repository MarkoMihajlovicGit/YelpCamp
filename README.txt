YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a project that was completed as a part of Colt Steele's bootcamp. My version of YelpCamp has a few tweaks beyond what was coded in class.

Setup
Different setups are needed if you plan on using YelpCamp locally (or Cloud9) verus the Heroku + MongoLab setup. This is accomplished using enviornment variables.
